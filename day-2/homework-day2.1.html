          This week I am <em>extremely</em> about cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>.
          In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerde the food(usually
          vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath thar is aprecisele set to
          the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. 
          In this book, <cite> Cooking <i>fir</i> Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes ir as " ultra-low temperature poaching".
