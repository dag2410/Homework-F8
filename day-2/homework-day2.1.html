        This week I am <i>extremely</i> about cooking technique called
        <i>sous vide</i>. In sous vide cooking, you submerde the food(usually
        vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath thar is aprecisele set to
        the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In this book,
        Cooking <i>fir</i> Geeks, Jeff Potter describes ir as " ultra-low
        temperature poaching" .
